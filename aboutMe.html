                    My career goal is to be in one of the sciences, whether it is 
                    computer science, aeronautical science, or zoological science. 
                    I want to enjoy my job. To achieve this goal, I will go to a four-year
                    university. I want to go to college because I enjoy learning. I enjoy logical thinking so a 
                    career in science would make sense for me.
                    <br><br>
                    I am punctual, resourseful and responsible. These strengths will
                    help me in my career. I have demonstrated these traits in my academics
                    and extracrurriculars.
                    <br><br>
                    Most of my major accomplishments in High School come from extracurriculars.
                    I am part of our successful marching band. Marching band has taught me how
                    to be individually responsible, and how to work well with a team. I have
                    also been part of a competitive robotics team. In four years we have been
                    1st place three times, been 2nd once, and have been recognized for Judges'
                    Choice three times.
